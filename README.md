# pandas-challenge

In this challenge we looked at a local school district's data and pulled several key pieces of infomration to explain how budgets, spend, and student success are related to one another. 

Through using a pd. merge function we were able to combine all of these files to get a succinct table to further analyze the trends. To start we used basic functions to claculate the schools, their sizes, the amount of students, budgt, and their scores in reading and math. Next we grouped these schools to understand the trends specifically to look at how much funding the schools got. For each school specifically we looked at how their students were performing (were they passing in math and reading?). Finally, we looked at the amount that each school spent. 

Two really intersting points that we can take from this data set: 
1. It seems that the school's spend per student on the lowest performing schools were actually higher. Something that a school district may want to investigate is how are these resources being allocated?
2. Charter schools were better performing (grades wise) than district schools. Something that may be worth investigating is where the funds come from. As we know charter schools are funded by a mix of public and private funds, while district schools are all publicly funded through the government.
